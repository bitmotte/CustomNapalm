# custom napalm!!!! !

helo, this is my first git project, and i'm not very good at unity modding, so this probably wont go anywhere.

as of current i have a cube that shoots out the firestarter!!!! wowie!!! i'll soon add a menu to choose different items.


see https://github.com/silliusgoober/CustomNapalmUSIDE for the unity project, where the assetbundles are.
